This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<h1>Mountain Project API fun</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Mountain Project top routes APP . You can you can browse popular routes based on style.</p>

<h2>Successes</h2>
I am still getting the hang of React. The main goal of this app was to become familar with componentizing(is that a word?) items and experiment with calling public apis. To keep it fun I went with a wacky style. I also brought in some third party components to see how all that worked in React.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
The main challenge came at the end when I realized that MP makes it very difficult to query users. I wanted to have a face-off component that compares tow user's stats but was unable to add that feature since MP uses unique ids paired with emails for every user.

<h2>Setup</h2>
Clone this repo: git clone
Then install the library dependencies. Run:

npm install

The 'npm run start'

Navigation to localhost:3000 should do it.

It's a Create-react-app.
